		<p>The guys over at 1320 Video have been around since 2003. They got their started posting street racing videos, but over the years have grown and exploded into
		   the main stream. Now they get invited all over the world to attened and record events. I highly reccomend checking out thier videos to some some of the fastest true
		   street cars in the world.</p>

		<p> Streetcar Takeover is focused on "street cars". To them as long as it is insured and has a license plate it is a street car. Keep in mind some of these cars
		     are <em>WELL</em> over 1500whp some are close to 3000whp on kill mode. To put that in perspective most exotic cars i.e. Lamborghini, McLaren, and Ferrari all 
		     have around 600whp. Streetcar Takeover is a track focused orginization hosting different events all over the country. </p>
