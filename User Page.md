<h2> Step one </h2>
	<p> &nbsp; The first thing you should do before ever leaving the house is, <em>INSPECT YOUR CAR!!!!</em> Below will be a basic list of things to inspect for.</p>
		<ol>
			<dd>Check your safety equipment</dd>
			<dd>Check your vehicle for leaks</dd>
			<dd>Inspect your tires, both the driving and racing</dd>
			<dd>Remove unnecessary items from the vehicle</dd>
			<dd> If you have a pancake compressor load it up</dd>
		</ol>
<h2> Step two</h2>
	<p> &nbsp; When you get to the track, prepping for the track inspection.</p>
		<ol>
			<dd> Remove driver floor mats "if not already removed"</dd>
			<dd> Swap over to racing tire set up</dd>
			<dd> Get track safety inspection </dd>
		</ol>
<h2> Step three</h2>
	<p> &nbsp; This is where the fun begins. Getting ready to go down the track.</p>
		<ol>
			<dd> Check your tire pressures. These pressures will vary depending on power levels and type of tires</dd>
			<dd> Drive up to the staging lane and follow track offical instructions</dd>
