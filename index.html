<h3> 
Introduction
</h3>
<body>
<p>
	Hello everyone my name is Jason Whitmore. I am making this website for my CPT422 Hypertext markup Language Programming class. 
	I am a Technical Sergeant in the Air Force with 12 years of experience under my belt. 
	If you do not include basic training or technical school, I have been stationed at two different duty locations. 
	My first duty station was <a href="https://www.ellsworth.af.mil/"> Ellsworth Air Force Base</a>. 
	I was stationed in South Dakota 9 years 2008 until 2017. 
	In 2017 I was lucky and was able to PCS to <a href="https://www.eglin.af.mil/"> Eglin Air Force Base.</a> 
	The way it looks I will probably retire here. 
	Let us be real though can you think of a worse place to retire?
</p>
<p> 
	I met my wife in junior high, at that point in our life we were not huge fans of each other. 
	We started dating back in 2003 which would have been my freshman year and her 8th grade year. 
	In 2008 we got married after I had graduated from technical school and was in route to our first duty station. 
	In 2009 we had Joseph our first child and then in 2012 we had our second child Jayden. 
	Along with our two wonderful children we have the best dog in the world Sweety.
	We found her in the paper in 2008 and have had her ever since. 
</P>
<h3> 
Hobbies 
</h3>
<p> 
	I would say that I have three major hobbies. 
	My first hobby is more of passion than a hobby. 
	But wrestling is huge passion of mine, If you watch the Olympics you will see two of the three different styles of wrestling. 
	You have Freestyle, Greco-Roman, and Folkstyle. 
	Folkstyle is what you see see in High School and College, Freestyle and Greco-Roman is what you see in the Olympics and other major world tournaments. 
	I learned way to late how much fun and how much joy I got from teaching kids how to wrestle. 
	I tried to convince my oldest (Joseph) to wrestle for years and he always said no. 
	When his younger brother (Jayden) was older I to finally able to convince Joseph to wrestle. 
	Jayden was still a year too young to wrestle at this point. 
	The following year both of them were wrestling. 
	Unfortunately we ended up leaving and have not been able to find youth wrestling program around us down here in Florida. 
</p>
<p> 
	My second hobby or passion is football.	At the college level, the only team I am rooting for is The Ohio State Buckeyes. 
	I do not really care for the NFL, but I do watch the Cincinnati Bengals. It is not that I root for the Bengals, I just want to see Joe Burrow become one of the greats.
	Mr. Burrow grew up 10 miles down the road from me so, he is our local hero. 
	To me if you want to watch the best football go watch some Friday night High School football. 
	Those kids are out there playing because they love the sport and are having fun while doing it. 
	College kids are playing to either pay for school or to try and make it to the NFL. 
	The NLF players are only playing because they are getting paid to play.
	</p> 
<p> 
	My third hobby is automobiles. 
	I like learning about cars and tinkering with them. 
	It is crazy seeing what kind of technology is coming down the pipeline. 
	If you want to know what kind of technology is coming down the pipe look at Mercedes. 
	They are typically at the forefront of up and coming technology in passenger cars. 
	My fascination with cars has led me down a rabbit hole with my own car. 
	I currently own a 2004 Infiniti G35 that comes stock with 280hp or 225whp.
	After many years of tinkering and modifying my car now makes 620hp or 540whp. 
	I would not have been able to get to this page if it were not for forums. 
	My go to forum is <a href="https://my350z.com/forum/engine-and-drivetrain-50/"> My350z</a>even though I do not own a 350z. 
	The 350Z and G35 are mechanically the same, and the 350Z forum has twice the following the G35 forum has. 
	Now if I have G35 specific problems I will go to <a href="https://g35driver.com/forums/tech-area-v35-17/">G35 Driver</a> and ask my questions.
	Here is a my car on the dyno. <a href="https://youtu.be/WAqgEO9e_LY"> 04 G35 Dyno Video.</a> 
	I would say that this is by far my most costly hobby. 
	Even though it has been an expensive endeavor,it has been well worth the journey.
